## ⚠️ Source Code Status

The **Hyperion Autonomous Engine** exists and is actively developed,  
however the **source code is currently private** due to an ongoing  
VEX Robotics Competition phase (2 competetions on the **27th** and **3th**).

This repository exists to:
- publicly document the project’s existence
- establish development timeline
- provide non-sensitive overview and visuals

**No source code is published here intentionally.**

---

## Project Overview

Hyperion is designed to help VRC teams:
- plan autonomous paths visually
- generate command-based VEXcode V5 output
- reduce manual math and tuning overhead
- focus on strategy instead of syntax

The system emphasizes **education**, **clarity**, and **competition reliability**.

---

## What Is Intentionally Omitted
- Source code
- Mathematical conversion formulas
- Internal algorithms
- Configuration logic

These will remain private until the competition season concludes  
(or may remain private indefinitely).
(However can show the code on request as a proof of existance)
